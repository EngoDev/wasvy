## Overview

Wasvy is an experimental integration between Bevy and WebAssembly (WASM), enabling the execution of WASM components within Bevy applications. This project aims to provide a seamless way to extend Bevy applications with WASM-based plugins and components.

## Vision

The ultimate goal of Wasvy is to create a vibrant ecosystem where:

- Game developers can easily make their games moddable with minimal boilerplate
- Modders can write mods in their language of choice (Rust, Python, etc.)
- Mods are sandboxed and safe to run
- The modding experience is as smooth as native code
- The ecosystem is vibrant with shared components and tools

## Features

- 🔌 WASM Component Model integration with Bevy
- 🎮 WASI support for WASM components
- 📦 Easy component loading and management

## Installation

Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
cargo add wasvy
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use wasvy::prelude::*;

/// Bevy drops assets if there are no active handles
/// so this resource exists to keep the handles alive.
#[derive(Resource)]
struct WasmAssets {
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    pub assests: Vec<Handle<WasmComponentAsset>>,
}

struct ExamplePlugin;

impl Plugin for ExamplePlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_systems(Startup, load_wasm_modules);
    }
}

fn load_wasm_modules(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    let handle = asset_server.load::<WasmComponentAsset>("path/to/your/component.wasm");

    commands.insert_resource(WasmAssets {
        assests: vec![handle],
    });
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();

    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins);

    // Adding the [`WasvyHostPlugin`] is all you need ;)
    app.add_plugins(WasvyHostPlugin);

    app.add_plugins(ExamplePlugin);

    app.run();
}
```

## Creating Compatible Components

To create a WASM component that works with Wasvy, you'll need to use the WebAssembly Component Model and define your interfaces using WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types). Here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

1. Install `cargo-component`:
```bash
cargo install cargo-component
```

2. Install `wkg` (WebAssembly Kit Generator):
```bash
cargo install wkg
```

### Creating a New WASM Component

1. Create a new component project:
```bash
cargo component new my-component --lib
cd my-component
```

2. Define your WIT interface in `wit/world.wit`. Here's a basic example:
```wit
package component:my-component;

world my-world {
    // For having access to ECS functions like register-component
    import wasvy:ecs/functions;
    
    /// This is important.
    /// This makes it so the WASM module must implement the guest required functions by the Bevy host.
    include wasvy:ecs/guest;

    use wasvy:ecs/types.{query-result};

    /// All systems must only have one argument of type `list<query-result>`
    export my_system: func(params: list<query-result>)
}
```

3. Configure `wkg` (Skip this if you already have it configured):
```bash
wkg config --edit
```
Then add the following line to your config:
```toml
default_registry = "wa.dev"
```
This will make `wkg` use `wa.dev` as the default registry, which is where Wasvy WIT files are stored.

4. Fetch the Wasvy WIT files from the registry:
```bash
wkg wit fetch
```

5. Build your component (This will also generate a `bindings.rs` file):
```bash
cargo component build --release
```
The resulting `.wasm` file will be in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_component.wasm`.

6. Implement your component in `src/lib.rs`. Check [`examples/simple/src/lib.rs`](examples/simple/src/lib.rs) for a full example:
```rust
#[allow(warnings)]
mod bindings;

use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use bindings::Guest;

struct GuestComponent;

impl Guest for GuestComponent {
    fn my_system(params: Vec<bindings::QueryResult>) {
        println!("Hello from my WASM component!");
    }

    /// This is a mandatory function that is called once at Bevy `Startup` schedule
    fn setup() {}
}

bindings::export!(GuestComponent with_types_in bindings);
```

### Using the Component

1. Place your compiled `.wasm` file in your Bevy project's assets directory
2. Load it using the `WasmComponentAsset` as shown in the Quick Start example

### Tips

- Check out the examples in this repository for more detailed usage
- Use `wkg` to generate bindings for any additional Bevy features you need
- The WIT registry at [WebAssembly Components Registry](https://wa.dev/) contains many useful interfaces
- You can use `cargo component` to manage dependencies and build configurations

## Examples

Check out the examples directory for more detailed usage:

- [`examples/host_example`](examples/host_example): Basic example on how to use the crate to run WASM components.
- [`examples/simple`](examples/simple): Basic WASM component in Rust.
- [`examples/python_example`](examples/python_example): Basic WASM component in Python.
